Use `GenerateVS2019.bat` to prepare and generate the solution and projects.
The generated files will be put in `Generated`, which can also be launched using `LaunchVS2019.bat`.
There are three projects in this repository:
* Triangle: drawing a 2D triangle using a single color fragment shader. 
* Cube: drawing a 3D cube using a basic shader.
* Model: drawing an actual 3D model from textures and obj files.
* Indices: drawing a 3D model using indices.
