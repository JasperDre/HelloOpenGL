# HelloOpenGL

Use `Setup.bat` to prepare and generate the solution and projects.
The generated files will be put in `Build`, which can also be launched using `Launch.bat`.
There are three projects in this repository:
* Triangle: drawing a 2D triangle using a single color fragment shader. 
* Cube: drawing a 3D cube using a basic shader.
* Model: drawing an actual 3D model from textures and obj files.
